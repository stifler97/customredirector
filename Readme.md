# Custom Redirector
This is a prestashop module which lets you map categories into each other and then when a customer opens a category page in FO of your shop, if you have specifed a redirection to another category, then the page redirects automatically to that category.
For example you want to redirect from id category of 22 into 55. Then you just need to add this line `22,55` in the `categoryMap.csv` and every thing happens automatically.
